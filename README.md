# Advanced Face Analysis üîÆ

## Project Description

**Advanced Face Analysis** is a modern web application built with **Node.js** and **Vue.js**, designed for real-time and photo-based face recognition and analysis directly in the browser. It enables users to analyze faces without sending any data to external servers ‚Äî everything is processed locally for maximum security and speed.

The goal of the project is to create a **user-friendly, efficient, and privacy-focused face analysis system** that works entirely in the browser.
